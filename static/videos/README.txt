# Video Files for SURVION Hero Section

The new hero section design uses a video background to create a more modern, dynamic look.

## Required Video File:
- **security-bg.mp4**: This should be a video file showing security-related footage (e.g., surveillance cameras, security technology, etc.)
- Recommended resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Duration: At least 10 seconds (preferably 30+ seconds) with a seamless loop
- Low compression for better quality

## If you don't have a video file:
1. The site will use the hero-bg.jpg as a fallback (specified in the poster attribute)
2. You can find free stock videos on sites like:
   - Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/videos/)
   - Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/videos/)
   - Videvo (https://www.videvo.net/)

Search for terms like "security", "surveillance", "technology", "digital", etc.

## Video Optimization
For web performance, compress your video:
- Use H.264 codec for MP4 format
- Target bitrate: 1500-2500 kbps
- Consider creating different sizes for responsive design

Place your video file in this directory with the name "security-bg.mp4" for the hero section to automatically use it.
